The Atheme GIT repository (Fewona version) can be checked out using the following command:
	$ git clone git://github.com/fewona/atheme.git atheme-fewona
	$ cd atheme-devel

If you need libmowgli, you should also run these commands to check it out into
the source tree.  This is, in theory, unnecessary if you have a system-wide
installation of libmowgli.
	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update
